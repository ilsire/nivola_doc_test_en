**What is SP**

The Nivola Service Portal (NSP) constitutes the Reserved Area for customers and integrates in a web interface all the functionalities offered by the platform. It provides the full range of functions designed to create, control and manage your own cloud services independently.
Through a set of simple and intuitive graphical wizards, all the services offered by Nivola can be used by users, even those without specific technical skills. The user can constantly monitor the status of resources through integration with monitoring dashboards, information and reports on costs and consumption, can create new services and communicate with the *Nivola Support Center* using different communication channels.
